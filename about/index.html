        <h4>Katra</h4>
        <p>Katra is the essence or spirit. In this case, the spirit of old basic computer games,
            like the ones we read in Byte, or Creative Computing.</p>
        <p>Katra was written to run these basic games from the golden age
            of basic programming.</p>
        <p>Specifically, Katra was created to run STAR TREK, from the original
            basic code written for the HP by Mike Mayfield in 1972.</p>
